# Taco Bell App UI (Figma Prototype)

This project is a **UI/UX design prototype** created in **Figma**, inspired by the Taco Bell mobile app.  
It is not a functional application — instead, it demonstrates the look and flow of a potential app interface.

## 📱 Screens Designed
The prototype currently includes three key screens:

1. **Splash Screen**  
   - Displays the Taco Bell logo and tagline.  
   - Provides navigation to **Sign In** or **Get Started**.

2. **Login Screen**  
   - Sign in via email and password.  
   - Options to log in with Google or Facebook.  
   - Includes "Remember me" and "Forgot password?" features.

3. **Home Screen**  
   - Delivery location selector and search bar.  
   - Visual menu of food items.  
   - Bottom navigation bar: **Home, Search, Orders, Account**.
